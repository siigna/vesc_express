 * Parsing of the on-flash script container. No firmware dependencies on
 * purpose: this is the one part of the script engine that is pure arithmetic
 * over untrusted bytes, so it is the part worth testing exhaustively on a
 * host. See main/script/test.
 *
 * Everything here treats the blob as hostile. It arrives over the packet
 * protocol from whatever is on the other end of a USB or BLE link, it is
 * stored in flash across reboots, and a truncated upload leaves a partial one
 * behind. An offset or length taken on trust is an out-of-bounds read at
 * best.
