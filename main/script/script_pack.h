/*
 * The on-flash script container, shared by both script engines.
 *
 * This is the layout VESC Tool has always written for LispBM, and nothing
 * about it is lisp-specific: the firmware reads the source as bytes and the
 * import table by name. Keeping it byte-for-byte means the existing upload,
 * erase, run/stop and REPL commands (COMM_LISP_*, 130-139 and 152) carry Lua
 * unchanged, and one package store serves both engines.
 *
 *   offset 0   uint32  size of everything after the crc field
 *   offset 4   uint16  crc16 over everything after the crc field
 *   offset 6   uint16  flags        <- see SCRIPT_FLAG_* below
 *   offset 8   char[]  source, NUL terminated
 *              uint16  number of imports
 *              per import:
 *                 char[]  name, NUL terminated
 *                 int32   offset of the payload, relative to offset 8
 *                 int32   length of the payload
 *
 * All multi-byte fields are big endian, as everywhere else in the protocol.
 *
 * The flags field is the one piece of slack in the original design: VESC Tool
 * writes zero and the firmware has never read it. That makes it the natural
 * place to record which language the source is, so a mixed package store can
 * be told apart without a new command id or a change to the container.
